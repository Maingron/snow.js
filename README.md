# Snow.js

### Official Website / Project site: https://maingron.com/snowjs

Snow.js spawns snow over your website. Updates will follow. Development started on 2019/11/05.

To implement it onto a website, just go to the end of your HTML and paste this:
```html
<script src="snow.js" async></script>
```

Make sure to copy snow.js into your website directory and check, if the link is right. If you want to modify the snow, you can do it in the snow.js file.
