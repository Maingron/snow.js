# Snow.js

### Official Website / Project site: https://maingron.com/snowjs

Snow.js spawns snow over your website. Updates will follow. Development started on 2019/11/05.

To implement it onto a website, just go to the end of your HTML and paste this:
```html
<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maingron/snow.js/master/snow.js" async></script>
```

If you want to be able to configure snow.js, download it and modify the snow.js file. Make sure to link to **your** js file.
